    "text": "To solve this problem using simulation it’s important to identify the inputs, the objective, make some calculations to arrive to your objective, and use repetitions so that the solution is stable.\n\n\n\n\nStart by including all the inputs provided by the problem in your R code.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, the demand is modeled using the triangular distribution with minimum of 500, maximum of 2500 and mode of 1500.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of bottles the company can supply in any given period is uncertain. The supply is modeled using the beta distribution with an alpha of 2 and beta of 5.

    "text": "Let’s learn how to summarize data by groups…\n\n\n\n\nSometimes data has dimensions we can use to group. For example, this data records the total power generated by each participant in a spin class. The gender variable has two dimensions, as well as the instructor one.\n\n\n\n\nThe value of grouping the data by dimensions in a variable, is to be able to compare descriptive statistics for the different groups. If, for example we wanted to see how instructors compare. We can first group the data by instructor, and then calculate a mean to see how their averages differ.\n\n\n\n\nThis code generates the means, when grouping by each instructor. The code is read as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThis line specifies the tibble we will be working with (i.e., spin) and how to group the data. The group_by() function is used to specify the variable we will use to create our groupings. Since there are only 2 instructors (i.e., Sam and Olivia), only two groups will be created.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use the summarise() function to specify how we want to summarize the groups. Within the function we will specify a name for the output table and a function to use tied to that name. Hence, for the class size we will use Size and specify to count the number of observations under each instructor. The Mean output will calculate the mean of all of the Total_kj generated by each instructor’s class.\n\n\n\n\nThe result is a table that tells us what how many people took each instructors class, and the respective average output of their participants (i.e., effort). Seems like Olivia is a tough one!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  Total_kj Gender Instructor\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     \n1      227 M      Olivia    \n2      157 M      Olivia    \n3      165 F      Olivia    \n4       87 M      Sam       \n5      240 M      Olivia    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspin %&gt;% group_by(Instructor) %&gt;% \nsummarise(Size=n(),\n          MeanPower=mean(Total_kj)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Instructor  Size MeanPower\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Olivia        30      197.\n2 Sam           30      121."
