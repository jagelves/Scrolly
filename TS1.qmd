When analyzing time series data in R there are some important steps to follow. Below is example code that loads BTC data and creates a time series object to analyze. @cr-pic

Be careful and always follow these steps. @cr-features

Start by cleaning the directory and loading the necessary packages. [@cr-features]{hlz="1-4"}

Continue by loading the data into R by using the `read_csv()` function and making sure you put the path in quotations. [@cr-features]{hlz="6"}

Lastly, make sure that the *Date* variable is recognized in the format *month/day/year* by using the `mdy()` function and specifying it as the index for in the `tsibble()` function. [@cr-features]{hlz="8-10"}

:::{#cr-features}
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(fpp3)
library(ggthemes)

BTC<-read_csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/BTC_USD.csv")

BTC_ts <- BTC %>%
  mutate(Date = mdy(Date)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = Date)
```
